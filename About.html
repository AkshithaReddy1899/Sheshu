          Hello all...myself Uday...
         <br/>
          I'm from Hyderabad...
          <br />
          I have started my own institute in April 2021 under the name LGFH.
          <br />
          The reason behind this is a very long story, but to cut it short...
          <br />
          I was also one you guys...who was in search of German courses.
          <br />
          But the fee structures shocked me.
          <br />
          Then I decided to help students and working professionals, who are seriously looking for affordable prices. After finishing my diploma, I have started this institute.
          <br />
          And I assure you that no other institute gives you the course at this price with this good explanation and standards.
          <br />
          I would be happy enough if you guys can go through my old students' reviews...
          <br />
          Feedback is so transparent, that I asked them to give any suggestions or corrections needed, but alas...only positive reviews...you have their mail ids as well...you can talk to them...
